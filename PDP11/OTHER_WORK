Work list
  pdp11_lp.c : Add code to use a (mapped) serial line for use with a real printer.
     status  : Work in progress.
       what  : Minimal coded added as an initial tryout.

  pdp11_cr.c : Add code to use a (mapped) serial line for communication with a real punchcard reader.
     status  : Notes only

  pdp11_pt.c : Add code o use a (mapped) serial line for communication with a real PC05.
     status  : work in progress.
       what  : Initial code added for attach, detach & service routines to use a simple packet
               exchange between SIMH and he PC05.
               Code will assume that both devices (punch & reader) are configured.

Wish list
  pdp11_tu.c : use a real TU56 (microcontroller)
     status  : A controller exists, but not complete. A new design is being made by Swedish enthusiasts.
     
  pdp11_rk.c : use a real RK05 (microcontroller)
     status  : Only a wish for the moment.
     
  pdp11_rl.c : use a real RL02
     status  : Using a microcontroller/FPGA combo exits, but no support/help whatsoever from the creator.
               Also, no real boards exists (yet).
